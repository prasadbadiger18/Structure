/*Explanation:
Structure Definition (typedef struct Student {...} student;):

Defines a Student structure with three fields: name, mark1, mark2, and mark3.
The typedef allows you to use student as an alias for struct Student, making it more concise.
Average Function (float Average(student s)):

Takes a student structure as input and returns the average of mark1, mark2, and mark3.
The marks are summed and divided by 3.0 (using 3.0 ensures the division is done in floating-point to get a decimal result).
Main Function (int main() {...}):

Declares an array studentss of size 1, which will hold one student structure.
Input Loop:

Loops once (i < 1) to prompt the user to enter the name and marks for the student.
Uses scanf to read values and store them in the respective fields of studentss[i].
Important: For name, no & is used because studentss[i].name is already a pointer to the first character of the array. For the marks, & is used to pass the address of the fields.
Output Loop:

Loops once to display the mark1, mark2, and mark3 fields for the student.
Calls the Average function with studentss[i] and prints the result.
This program captures the studentâ€™s name and three marks, then calculates the average using the Average function and displays the details.
