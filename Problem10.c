Explanation of the Program
Structure Definition: The Product structure defines three fields: name for the product name, price for the product price, and quantity for the stock quantity. This provides a blueprint for each product in the program.

Sorting Function:

sortProductsByPrice() is a function that uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of Product structures based on their price in ascending order.
It uses nested loops: the outer loop controls how many passes are made through the array, and the inner loop performs the comparison and swapping of adjacent elements.
If the price of the current product is greater than the next one, they are swapped using a temporary Product variable.
Print Function:

printProducts() is a function that takes the sorted list of products and prints each oneâ€™s name, price, and quantity.
It iterates through the list using a for loop and formats the output with printf().
Main Function:

The program starts in main() by asking the user for the number of products they want to enter.
An array of Product structures named products is declared, with the size based on user input.
The program then loops to receive each product's name, price, and quantity from the user.
After inputting the data, the program sorts the products by calling sortProductsByPrice() and then prints the sorted list using printProducts().
This program provides a simple way to organize and display products in ascending order based on their price, helping users manage and view product information more effectively.
