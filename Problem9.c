/*Explanation of Key Sections:
Structure Definition:

The struct movie defines a blueprint for a movie's data. It includes fields for the title, director, and release year.
Dynamic Memory Allocation:

malloc is used to allocate memory for an array of movie structures, where the size is based on the user's input (numofmovies). This way, we only use as much memory as needed.
The type casting (struct movie *) is used to cast the void pointer returned by malloc to the correct data type.
User Input:

The program reads and stores each movie's title, director, and release year one by one. The scanf function is used to get user input for each field.
Note: scanf with %s does not handle spaces well; using fgets instead of scanf for the strings would allow multi-word titles and director names.
Data Display:

The program prints out each movieâ€™s details by looping over the array, using movies[i] to access each element.
Memory Deallocation:

Finally, free(movies); is used to release the dynamically allocated memory back to the system, preventing memory leaks.
This code efficiently collects and stores movie information for a user-defined number of movies, then displays the stored information.*/
